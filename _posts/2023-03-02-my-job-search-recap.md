After 4 weeks of very aggressive job searching, I was able to wrap up my job search late last week and I decided on an an offer yesterday. Hooray! This is the first time in my career that I've been able to devote so much time to job searching and while it was extremely draining, it was also a great learning experience. First, some stats:

* I either submitted an application (~85%) or had someone from the company proactively reach out to me (~15%) with **76** companies.
    * I had interviews with **22** companies (spoke with **66** individuals).
        * Of the 22 companies I interviewed with, only **TWO** were where I submitted an application without a referral and it led to a phone/video conversation.
        * I went beyond the initial recruiter phone screen with **15** companies.
        * I had final interviews with **5** companies.
            * I received offers from **3** companies, all within 1 week. The offers came in **4** calendar days on average after the final interview. It took **17** calendar days on average between my first conversation with someone from the company until I received the offer.
    * Of the 57 companies I never got to interview with, I got a rejection email from **20** companies. The rejection email was sent to me **8.25** calendar days on average from the time I submitted my application. The shortest was 1 minute (impressive!). The longest was 21 calendar days (not impressive).

Lessons learned:
* **Referrals:** Referrals are the way to go when it comes to applying for jobs. 64% of the companies I applied to with a referral led to at least 1 conversation with someone from the company.
* **Prepare!:** Interview prep makes a big difference. I did terrible on my first system design interview. I learned my lesson and then did a fair amount of reading and watching relevant YouTube videos. The subsequent system design interview sessions went WAY better. I also had some earlier-than-expected rejections after non-technical interview sessions that I felt went pretty well actually. Eventually, though, I was able to sharpen my responses and the rate of early rejections went down to 0.
* **Referrals, again:** *Just* submitting an application without doing anything else is not a good use of time... but at the same time, I would not say it's a complete waste of time either. Of the companies I applied to without a referral:
    * 1 reached back out to me for a phone screen. I passed the phone screen > passed their LeetCode-style coding test. By then, though, I already had an offer so I told them I decline to go further in the interview process.
    * I had a recruiter phone screen with another company but did not hear back from the company afterwards.
    * 1 company reached out to me over email and we scheduled an initial phone screen. A day before the phone screen, however, they told me they wanted to move in a different direction.
    * 1 company reached out to me over email and asked me to write up a lengthy essay that talks about all of my biggest accomplishment. I really did not want to... and thankfully by then, I had an offer and told them I would like to no longer move forward.

Overall - I'm thankful. While it was *really* exhausting, I got to talk to a lot of companies and make a lot of new connections along the way. I'm really thankful for my amazing network of friends, family, and former colleagues. I'm looking forward to traveling for a few weeks before starting my new job on 3/31!
