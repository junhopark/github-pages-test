title: Tips for my next trip to Korea

I recently returned home after a memorable 3-week trip to Korea with my parents and my youngest child. This was my 7th trip back to Korea after immigrating to the US in 1991 and there’s no doubt I’ll be returning to Korea within the next few years for yet another visit. Here’s a list of reminders to myself for the next time I decide to return to Korea (and I hope this list is helpful for those of you who are planning on visiting Korea):

* **Bring a more compact stroller:** I’m not sure if my youngest will still be small enough to be able to ride in a stroller the next time I visit Korea but if she is - I should bring a compact stroller (that I can still maneuver with one hand). I brought a Britax stroller that is considered to be a compact stroller in the US, it's not compact in Korea & was a pain to lug around. It barely fit into the trunk of taxis when folded (there were a few taxis where I wasn't able to squeeze it into the trunk) and it was really cumbersome to carry around up and down the escalators. 
* **Useful mobile apps:** The most useful mobile apps for me were as follows:
    * Naver Maps: GPS navigation, incl. public transit
    * Kakao Taxi: Like Uber/Lyft
    * Kakao Talk: Essential messaging app when in Korea
    * Trip.com: Like Expedia. I used it to book a 3-day trip to Jeju Island and got a really good price (around $600 for flight, hotel, rental car - for 4 people)
    * Papago: Translation app
    * Karrot (당근): Used marketplace app
* **SIM card:** Like when I traveled to Korea in late 2021, I purchased a SIM card (tied to a Korean phone number) on trazy.com and while I was satisfied with it in 2021, I was not satisfied this time around. I ran into a frustrating issue where my SIM card didn’t work for about 30 minutes until after I landed in Korea, customer support wasn’t great, and it felt expensive. I need to research a better option the next time I travel to Korea. If I’m gonna be out and about throughout the trip (ie, lack of Wi-Fi hotspots) I think I need to estimate about 2-3GB of data per week. 
* **Ideally need both US + Korean phone numbers:** While I was in Korea, I only had access to a Korean phone number and not also my US phone number. Next time I travel to Korea, I need to find a way to have access to both Korean & my regular US number. During my visit to Korea this time around, there were some inconveniences I had to endure due to 2 factor authentications being tied to my US phone number. 
* **Exchange less cash:** I brought & exchanged way too much cash (USD to KRW) for this visit because when I was in Korea, I repeatedly ran into issues where my (US-based) credit cards were rejected. This time around - this issue took place very infrequently. Next time I travel to Korea, I think I’ll still bring an ample amount of USD cash with me but only exchange a relatively a small amount to KRW. FYI - I got a good exchange rate at a place called Money Box in Insadong.
* **Hotel:** I stayed at Orakai Insadong Suites (booked it on booking.com) this time and I loved it. My parents loved it as well. It’s very likely that I’ll want to stay there again the next time I visit. The price (around $145/might) was fantastic for what I ended up getting (2 bedrooms, 1 bath, kitchen, living room, large laundry room that’s the size of a tiny bedroom) plus access to a large pool and a nice fitness center. Plus the location of the hotel is fantastic (Insadong / 인사동) with a lot of stores, street vendors, and very close to multiple public transit stops. 
* **Bring a better travel tripod:** I need to invest in a better, more travel-friendly tripod for my next visit to Korea. I brought a cheap one with me from home, lost it about a week into my trip, and then bought a $4 one at Daiso. It was better than not having one but… it sucked. 
* **My favorite place to shop:** Next time I come to Korea, I need to head straight to a Daiso (or, several Daisos) as soon as I arrive in Korea.
