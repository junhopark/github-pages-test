I spend a lot of time at work in meetings. I regularly think about having effective and efficient meetings and here's a list of things that I think are important when it comes to doing meetings well.

* **Keep meetings as short as possible:** I think the vast majority of meetings can be had in 30 minutes. Some in 15 minutes. Anything over 30 minutes should be an exception. In my experience [Parkinson's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law) very much applies to meetings. Starting meetings on time & getting right down to business help with keeping meetings short. If you're in a recurring meeting and there's regularly time left over during meetings, make the future meeting occurrences shorter.
* **Keep # of attendees as small as possible:** "Who absolutely needs to be at the meeting?" is a good question to ask before sending out the meeting invite. As a rule of thumb more people = slower & more inefficient meetings.
* **Do not start meetings from a blank slate:** Make sure there's an agenda for the meeting. If the purpose of the meeting is to discuss a particular topic - it's always best for there to be some document that the meeting attendees review *prior to* attending the meeting. As the meeting owner - hold people accountable to actually reviewing the document before the meeting takes place.
* **Take notes. Share them out:** Meetings are mostly a waste of time if nothing got written down and meeting notes didn't get shared out. The vast majority of people do not have anything close to resembling a photographic memory, which is why writing things down is so important. It's terribly inefficient and frustrating to have to re-visit & question something that was already discussed and settled on simply because things didn't get written down. As I wrote about in [this blog post](https://junhopark.com/2021/01/24/note-taking-and-documentation-for-engineering-manager.html) I would encourage people to not only share their notes but to post their notes on a company-public wiki.
* **Hold people accountable to action items from meetings:** Doing this is made much easier if the bullet point right above this gets done.
* **Avoid scheduling last minute meetings:** I consider meetings that get scheduled during the same week as being "last minute". Sometimes this is unavoidable but I like to avoid scheduling last minute meetings as much as possible. When people start work on Monday they should have a good idea of what their schedule for the rest of the week looks like.
