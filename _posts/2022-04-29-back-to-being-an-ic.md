I recently transitioned to an individual contributor role (Android development) after having been in various engineering management roles since July of 2014. Over the last roughly 1.5 years I had the following realizations that ultimately resulted in me returning to an IC role.

* I realized I have no desire to climb the management ladder. While I used to be motivated by having an increasing number of people under my supervision, I found myself no longer being motivated by this.
* I enjoy & thrive being in the weeds and I realized I was much more fulfilled when my time and energy were spent on technical things (code reviews, architectural discussions, investigating production issues, etc.) than when I was performing your typical managerial tasks.
* I got sick of being in so many meetings. Roughly 50 - 75% of my working hours were spent in meetings and it eventually became too much for me. I realized that my happiness level at the beginning of each workday was inversely proportional to how much meetings are on my calendar for the day.
* I missed building and shipping code. I missed the constant dopamine hit I got by making stuff work, closing out Jira tickets, resolving a nasty bug, coming up with creative solutions to technical challenges, etc.

I've been in my IC role now for about 3 months and it has been *fantastic*. It's everything I was looking forward to. I went from spending 4 - 8 hours each day in meetings to often having less than 1 hour of meeting/day. 1-2 days a week I'm in meetings for less than 30 minutes/day, which would've been unthinkable as a manager. Most of my time at work is spent inside of Android Studio and not in Microsoft Teams and Slack. It's quite wonderful and liberating. Having been a manager for 7.5 years, one thing I got really good at was driving myself and the team towards getting things done and this has helped me to be a more productive developer than before my management days. Just in the last 3 months I've learned quite a bit. I missed learning new things as a manager and now in my IC role, I find myself learning new things almost every day.

I'm thankful for the opportunity to be able to shift to an IC role at Venmo without having to be demoted or to even feel like I'm being demoted. I'm still getting to work with the same people I used to work with and work on the same product and features I used to help manage, which has been great because I have a lot of context.

I suppose it's possible that one day I may want to go back to being a manager. But for now - I'm really enjoying being an IC and wish I had made the switch even sooner.
