# 10,000 Reasons

***CHORUS***

Bless the Lord oh my soul, oh my soul

Worship His Holy name

Sing like never before, oh my soul

I’ll worship Your Holy name

***VERSE 1***

The sun comes up, it’s a new day dawning

It’s time to sing Your song again

Whatever may pass and whatever lies before me

Let me be singing when the evening comes

***VERSE 2***

You’re rich in love and You’re slow to anger

Your name is great and Your heart is kind

For all Your goodness I will keep on singing

Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find

***VERSE 3***

And on that day when my strength is failing

The end draws near and my time has come

Still my soul will sing Your praise unending

Ten thousand years and then forevermore


# Lord Most High

***VERSE***

From the ends of the earth

From the depths of the sea

From the heights of the heavens

Your name we praise

From the hearts of the weak

From the shouts of the strong

From the lips of all people

This song song we raise Lord

***CHORUS***

Throughout the endless ages

You will be crowned with praises

Lord most high

Exalted in every nation

Soverign of all creation

Lord most high

Be magnified
