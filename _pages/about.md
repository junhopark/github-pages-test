Hi, my name is Junho Park. Professionally, I spent many years as a software engineer and transitioned to engineering management in 2014. I'm currently working as an engineering manager at [Venmo](https://venmo.com/).

Outside of work, my biggest interests & hobbies are music, reading, fitness, and personal finance.
