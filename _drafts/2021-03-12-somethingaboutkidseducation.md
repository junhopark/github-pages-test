I recently finished reading the book *Teach Your Children Well* by Madeline Levine and the book got me thinking a lot about how to best educate my own children who are currently 6 and 4 years old. I grew up in South Korea until the age of 10 and I grew up with my mom emphasizing a *ton* on me getting good grades. I remember staying up late into the night before I was 10 years old and that was normal for me. Getting good grades was a big part of my identity at least when I was growing up in Korea and it was a source of tremendous pride for my parents that I was excelling in school. I was tutored, took piano lessons, took programming lessons, and spent a lot of time studying. *A lot of time.*

After finishing the above book and after doing some thinking I re-realized something important. Based on my own experience of working for 20+ years **no one really cares where you went to college.** And **no one gives any thought to what your GPA was in college.** The only exception is when we're talking about folks who are *just starting out* in their particular industry. But I think once you're past your very first job - where you went to college and what grades you got in school matter basically nothing.

When I think about the hundreds of colleagues I've worked with throughout my career so far here's the list of *actually* valuable skills that I've witnessed in my high-performing colleagues:

* **Communication:** They speak & write clearly. They're able to articulate and share what they know.
* **Problem solving:** When they come across a problem they don't quite know how to solve - they figure out ways to solve the problem. They're consistently tenacious & resilient when it comes to solving even extremely difficult problems.
*

* Collaboration

* Dependability => seems more like a personality trait
* Ability to learn
* Ability to execute
* Leadership - this encompasses many things

* Write this in a more notes / stream of consciousness blog post?

* Been reading book Teach Your Children Well by Madeline Levine - got me thinking about kids and education - I have 2 young children (6, 4)
* My upbringing - a TON of focus on education
* What I observe, as an adult, are valuable skills:

* Of course I want my kids to earn top grades and go to the best possible colleges. But - so many of the GOOD people I've worked with did not go to "top tier schools". Yes - if I find that my colleague went to, say, Stanford or MIT - there is the initial "ooh" effect and it is very quickly forgotten. I could care less.
