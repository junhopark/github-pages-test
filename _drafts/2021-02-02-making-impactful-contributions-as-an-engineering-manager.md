Despite having been an EM (engineering manager) for nearly 7 years I still find myself occasionally struggling with the question of "How much value am I *really* adding?" Like many EMs I'm in a lot of meetings--certainly way more than when I was an IC (individual contributor) developer. There are certainly days when it feels like all I do is go from one meeting to another and not accomplish much of anything. Not adding much value. Not making much of an impact. When I think back to the days when I was an IC it was noticeably easier to be productive. I was in way less meetings. I had much longer stretches of heads down time. The vast majority of my time at work involved writing and shipping production code and it was consistently easy to provide concrete evidences for the sort of impact I was making at work. Not so with being an EM--at least based on my own experience. I've found that I need to make much more of a conscious effort towards being impactful as an EM versus when I was an IC.

I find that being productive and making an impact at work is a constant yearning for me and so I wanted to take some time to write down what are the things that **I** do in order to be an impactful EM. Disclaimer: The list below isn't meant to be a universal list that are applicable to all EMs. I'm a big big believer that each EM has vastly different leadership & management styles and that the best EMs are ones that recognize & fully utilize their particular strengths and passions in carrying out their management responsibilities.

## Provide clarity
This blog post could've easily been titled something like "Providing Clarity" because in my opinion, the stuff that I'm including in this section is where I believe that my biggest impacts come from. ***ADD MORE HERE***
