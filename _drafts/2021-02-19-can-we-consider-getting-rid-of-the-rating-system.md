* felt that i had better convos w folks this year
* folks doing reall well - they expect highest rating; vast majority of other folks - it's deflating when their rating is "doing ok" - maaybe rating only useful for poorest performers?
* really liked not having to worry about rating as an EM. and on receiving end too?
